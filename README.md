# Asso'esaip Flutter application

This app is made for the [ESAIP](https://esaip.org/) Graduate School of Engineering Student Union, to be used with the [Asso'esaip website API](https://github.com/BriceChk/assoesaip-symfony).
Its goal is to give a nearly read-only experience (for now) of all the website contents to the students and the possibility to receive push notifications.
